# Sass Course
First Part it uses the Ruby Sass which should no longer be used <br>
In order to run the compiler of sass use the following command: sass --watch [sass route]:[css route] <br>
You need ruby and the sass gem to work with it <br>
sass -w [sass route]:[css route] --style expanded (normal css) <br>
sass -w [sass route]:[css route] --style compact (in just one line)<br>
sass -w [sass route]:[css route] --style compress (all the css is in one line)<br>
sass --watch assets/sass:public/CSS (in order to compile all the sass files at the same time)<br>
sass-convert styles.sass styles.scss (to convert into the other kind of sass)<br>
